# Contribution guidelines

### Master branch

Our `master` branche is the three main branche through which codes are tested and pushed through live `environment`. Any contribution needs to follow a proper `git-flow` to integrate your codes to these branches for testing and deployments.

### Work branch

Any new **work-branch** needs to be created from **master**. Once stable codes are ready, create a pull request to test your codes and reviewed by others.
